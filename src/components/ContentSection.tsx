            Imagine being able to understand, connect with, and collaborate with people from any 
            culture, without misunderstandings or unnecessary clashes. That's exactly what cultural 
            intelligence allows you to achieve.

          <p className="text-base md:text-lg">
            It's not just about learning customs or traditions, but about developing the ability to 
            adapt your thinking and behavior in culturally diverse situations. In today's 
            interconnected world, cultural intelligence has become an essential skill for success 
            in both personal and professional relationships.

            Whether you're working with international teams, traveling to new countries, or simply 
            engaging with diverse communities in your own city, being culturally intelligent opens 
            doors to deeper connections, better collaboration, and more meaningful experiences.
